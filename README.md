## WORK EXPERIENCE

#### **Research Assistant**
Universidad Pedagógica y Tecnológica de Colombia

+ Testing and correction of programs used in the laboratory along with their update in the Python language (libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn) through a GitHub repository.
+	The required information was investigated using online library resources and university data, in addition to the official documentation of the libraries used.
+	Standard processes and procedures were carried out to investigate new materials, as well as the comparison of materials already worked on in databases with SQL.
+	Review and improvement of processes for the creation of perovskite-type materials.
+	Document the design of the models, instructions for use and progress in the research carried out by the research group.
+	Feedback of the results found through data visualization (PowerBi).

#### **Mathematics and Physics teacher**
CorteOrinoquia
+	Design and teach effective mathematics and physics classes for competency-based technical students.
+	Explain concepts clearly and encourage active participation and critical thinking.
+	Evaluate student progress and provide constructive feedback.
+	Integrate technology and educational resources to enrich teaching.
+	Stay updated on educational advances and collaborate with other teachers.
+	Cultivate a learning environment that stimulates interest and understanding of subjects.

## DATA PROJECTS

Listed below are several personal projects that I have worked on on my own to practice and understand data science and data analytics work in greater depth. All projects have to a lesser and greater extent the following characteristics:

+ Data preprocessing.
+ Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
+ Analysis of observed data.
+ Feature selection (Feature Engineering).
+ Modeling.
+ Training and evaluation of the model used.
+ If an optimization was performed on the model.
+ Validation and presentation of the model.

#### Rate of Abandonment Employees in a Company [HERE](https://github.com/EstebanGarnicaMateus/EstebanGarnicaMateus.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Abandonment_Employees/Abandonment_employees.ipynb)

I was provided with a DataFrame that describes the characteristics of a company's employees. When studying the history of employees who resigned, the characteristics they shared were analyzed to determine the answer to the following question: __Which current employees have a high probability of resigning?__.

#### Information About Data Science Jobs [HERE](https://github.com/EstebanGarnicaMateus/EstebanGarnicaMateus.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Glassdoor_Data_Jobs/DS_glassdoor.ipynb)

A data set of job applications for the position of data scientist is available on GlassDoor. From this data, relevant information is extracted about the features that are being most requested.

#### Click on an Advertising [HERE](https://github.com/EstebanGarnicaMateus/EstebanGarnicaMateus.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Advertaising/ML_LR_microproject.ipynb)

A DataFrame containing the characteristics of a user is presented, along with information about whether this user has clicked on a banner ad or not. Using this data set, a prediction is made about whether another user with similar characteristics will click on the advertisement, using a logistic regression model (LRM).

#### KNN Algorithm to Classify Instances [HERE](https://github.com/EstebanGarnicaMateus/EstebanGarnicaMateus.github.io/blob/main/Projects/KNN/ML_KNN_microproject.ipynb)

Using a DataFrame as a data source and the KNN algorithm, the instances of the main data set will be classified into one of the target classes.

#### London Bike Sharing [HERE](https://github.com/EstebanGarnicaMateus/EstebanGarnicaMateus.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Bike_Sharing_London/Bike_sharing.ipynb)

I was given a DataFrame with data on bike sharing in London and a cleaning demo and brief visualization was carried out using the Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.

#### 🚧Information for Titanic Passengers [HERE](https://github.com/EstebanGarnicaMateus/EstebanGarnicaMateus.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Titanic/Titanic.ipynb)🚧

A Dataframe is used that contains the characteristics of various Titanic passengers, generating a visualization of the data. The different graphs allow a quick visual analysis of the data used.

#### 🚧Potential to Acquire Credit [HERE](https://github.com/EstebanGarnicaMateus/EstebanGarnicaMateus.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Credit_Bank_Potential/Credit_bank.ipynb)🚧

Data is collected from people interested in obtaining credit, considering their economic conditions to determine their eligibility. In addition, a predictive model of the probability of credit approval is developed for each applicant.

#### 🚧Forecast Movie IMDB [HERE](https://github.com/EstebanGarnicaMateus/EstebanGarnicaMateus.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Forecast_IMDB/Forecast_ML.ipynb)🚧

Data of various movies along with their characteristics are displayed. Considering these details, it is proposed to develop a model that can predict how much a film will gross based on its themes.

#### 🚧Calculation of Life Expectancy [HERE](https://github.com/EstebanGarnicaMateus/EstebanGarnicaMateus.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Life_Expectancy/Life_expectancy.ipynb)🚧

A Dataframe containing the characteristics of various people is used to create a prediction model. This model allows the life expectancy of an individual to be estimated based on their attributes and medical care history.
