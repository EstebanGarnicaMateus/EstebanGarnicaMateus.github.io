## ABOUT ME

Bilingual Physicist (ES-EN) from the [Universidad Pedagógica y Tecnológica de Colombia](https://www.uptc.edu.co/sitio) who has researched in the search for new semiconductor materials. My experience as a researcher allows me to delve into topics with high scientific rigor, in turn, it has shown me the value of continuing to study, in particular Data Science and Data Analytics, allowing me to extract knowledge through processes, algorithms and systems. and perceptions of data. in various forms.

## WORK EXPERIENCE

### Research Assitant
Universidad Pedagógica y Tecnológica de Colombia

+ Testing and correction of programs used in the laboratory along with their update in the Python language (libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn) through a GitHub repository.
+	The required information was investigated using online library resources and university data, in addition to the official documentation of the libraries used.
+	Standard processes and procedures were carried out to investigate new materials, as well as the comparison of materials already worked on in databases with SQL.
+	Review and improvement of processes for the creation of perovskite-type materials.
+	Document the design of the models, instructions for use and progress in the research carried out by the research group.
+	Feedback of the results found through data visualization (PowerBi).

### Mathematics and Physics teacher
CorteOrinoquia
+	Design and teach effective mathematics and physics classes for competency-based technical students.
+	Explain concepts clearly and encourage active participation and critical thinking.
+	Evaluate student progress and provide constructive feedback.
+	Integrate technology and educational resources to enrich teaching.
+	Stay updated on educational advances and collaborate with other teachers.
+	Cultivate a learning environment that stimulates interest and understanding of subjects.

## TALKS & OUTREACH
